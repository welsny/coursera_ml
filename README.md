### My Coding Assignments from Coursera's Machine Learning

The course homepage is located [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome). You can can view my course certificate at: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/8JMVLYPRSV55.

Assignments for this course were completed in [GNU Octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave), a free alternative to Matlab.
